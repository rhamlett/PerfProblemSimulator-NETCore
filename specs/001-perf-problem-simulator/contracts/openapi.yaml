  title: Performance Problem Simulator API
  description: |
    API for triggering and monitoring intentional performance problems in an Azure App Service
    application for educational and diagnostic demonstration purposes.
    
    ⚠️ **WARNING**: This API intentionally creates performance problems. It is designed for
    testing and learning purposes only. Do not use in production environments.
    
    ## Endpoint Categories
    
    - **Problem Triggers**: Endpoints that start performance problems
    - **Metrics**: Endpoints that report current application state
    - **Control**: Endpoints for managing simulations
    
    ## API Style
    
    This API uses action-oriented RPC-style endpoints (e.g., `/api/trigger-high-cpu`) rather than
    REST resource-based endpoints, as the operations are actions rather than resource management.

      summary: Trigger high CPU usage
      description: |
        Starts a CPU-intensive operation that spins all processor cores for the specified duration.
        The CPU usage will approach 100% and return to baseline when the duration expires.
        
        **Educational Note**: This endpoint uses `Parallel.For` with spin loops to saturate all
        available CPU cores, demonstrating how CPU-bound work affects application responsiveness.

        **Educational Note**: Memory is allocated as pinned byte arrays on the Large Object Heap
        (LOH), preventing garbage collection until explicitly released.

        **Educational Note**: After release, memory may not immediately return to baseline
        as the GC runs on its own schedule. Forcing GC can help demonstrate memory recovery.

      summary: Trigger thread pool starvation via sync-over-async
      description: |
        Demonstrates the sync-over-async anti-pattern by blocking ThreadPool threads.
        This causes thread pool starvation, leading to increased response times for all
        requests as the pool struggles to serve incoming work.
        
        **Educational Note**: This endpoint intentionally uses `.Result` to block threads,
        which is a common anti-pattern. Watch the thread pool metrics to see thread count
        climb while queue depth grows.

        This endpoint remains responsive even under thread pool starvation.

        independently of the ThreadPool, ensuring availability during starvation scenarios.
